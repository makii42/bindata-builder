go-bindata container
====================

This is a small [`Dockerfile`][Dockerfile] that builds a container to run [`go-bindata`](https://github.com/go-bindata/go-bindata).

The container is based on [`alpine linux`](https://alpinelinux.org/), which provides a great, tiny [runtime container](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine).

PRs welcome.
